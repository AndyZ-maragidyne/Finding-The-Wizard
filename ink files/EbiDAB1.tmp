"I'm glad we got out of there quickly. That much magic running wild can be extremely harmful."
* What happened exactly?
    "Well, when you interrupted the spell by distracting the wizard, you failed to take control over the spell's magic, which resulted in the magic becoming wild. When wild magic is that dense, it produces a variety of unpredictable effects. In this case, a lot of magical creatures appeared."
** What should we do?
    "We need to find the wizard; the immortality ritual is highly illegal. I'll be fine because I'm on the magic council, I'll probably just be removed from it. You on the other hand have no affiliation other than with the culprit, so you need to put some effort into giving people a reason to trust you. The best way to do that is to find the wizard, so get to it. Hopefully you learned a spell or two!
