"Ah my apprentice. All this, the cops, the wild magic, the failure of my ascencion; its all your fault! If you prostrate yourself before me, offer me your very soul, and beg for forgiveness, I'll let you leave here alive."
* No![] You decieved me.
"I've never lied to you. I've taught you magic, I've paid you, you can't just turn on me like this!"
** You left you crucial information.[] You never told me about the standard magic, about why magic works. You didn't even tell me your name, Alakazam the Mischeivous.
"Don't call me that! I've left that name behind long ago. I was going to remake my grand debut to the wizarding world. The ritual would've given me eternal life, eternal youth, unlimited mana potential. I would've been revered as Merlin the Everlasting!! You took all that from me. Now, cast what spells you can! I taught you everything you know, but I never taught you everything!"
